This is the repo for the "internetting is hard" tutorial in the Introduction to Flexbox section on TOP.

This will be my THIRD attmept at this exercise as it isnt visually coming out as it should.

Wish me luck....

UPDATE:
So far so good with HTML & CSS prior to the 
"Grouping Flex Items" portion. Everything in the ouput looks as it should.
